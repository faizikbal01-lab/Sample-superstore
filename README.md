📖 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze retail performance across the United States. It breaks down sales data by region, product category, and time period to identify profitability drivers and operational bottlenecks.

🌟 Key Features
Multi-Dimensional Analysis: Sales tracking across 4 regions (East, West, Central, South) and multiple product sub-categories (Bookcases, Chairs, Technology, etc.).

Data Engineering: Includes dedicated sheets for Data Cleaning (TRIM, PROPER, LEN) and Logical Functions.

Advanced Lookups: Implementation of VLOOKUP vs. HLOOKUP for dynamic report generation.

Automation: A dedicated module for Excel Macros to streamline repetitive reporting tasks.

Financial Health: Calculation of KPIs such as Profit Margin, Discount Impact, and Shipping Lag.

Core Insights Summarized
Based on the data analysis within these files:

Regional Performance: The East region shows significant volume, but regional pivots suggest high variability in "Tables" and "Bookcases" profitability.

Category Trends: Technology remains the highest-margin category, while Furniture often sees profit dips due to aggressive discounting (visible in the Discount vs Profit columns).

Operational Efficiency: Standard Class is the dominant shipping mode; however, the Ship Date analysis reveals opportunities to optimize lead times for the South region.
