# Sample-superstore
A comprehensive Excel Mastery project covering 12 core sections: from basic arithmetic and data cleaning to advanced Pivot Tables, LOOKUP functions, Includes hands-on tasks for financial modeling, data visualization, and automation.
This repository contains a comprehensive set of Excel workbooks and documentation covering a full spectrum of spreadsheet skills. The project is divided into 12 strategic sections designed to demonstrate proficiency in data manipulation, financial analysis, and process automation.
This is the primary data source containing transaction records for a retail "Superstore." 
It includes fields like: Demographics/Location: Customer Name, Segment, Country, City, State, and Region. Product Details: Category, Sub-Category, and Product Name.
Sales Metrics: Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Profit.
Descriptive & Regional Summaries (Sheet1, Sheet3, Sheet4, Sheet5)
These sheets contain aggregated data summaries, likely created using Pivot Tables or Manual Formulas:
Temporal Snapshots: Sheets labeled with "Jan Data," "March Data," and "Fab Data" (likely February) show sales performance broken down by Region (East, West, Central, South) and Sub-Category (e.g., Bookcases, Chairs, Labels).
Aggregated Metrics: Calculation of Subtotals, Averages, and Counts for specific product sales.
 Practical Data Cleaning & Manipulation (Sheet2)
This sheet is a functional "workbook" within the file that demonstrates a wide array of Excel data cleaning and processing techniques:
Text Cleaning: Extensive use of functions like UPPER, LOWER, PROPER, TRIM, LEN, RIGHT, LEFT, and MID to clean and reformat product and customer strings.
Data Splitting: Demonstrates "Text to Column" features to split names (e.g., First Name and Last Name) and joining them back using CONCATENATE or &.
Information Retrieval: Uses SEARCH vs. FIND and demonstrates Go To (Special) techniques.
 Logical & Lookup Operations (Sheet2)
Logical Analysis: Examples of IF, AND, OR functions, and IFERROR for handling conditional logic and data validation.
Advanced Lookups: Comparison and implementation of VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP to fetch data from the main Orders sheet based on Product IDs.
 Advanced Statistical & Formatting Techniques (Sheet2, Macros)
Statistical Counting: Demonstration of COUNT, COUNTA, and COUNTBLANK.
Growth Analysis: Calculation of Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth Percentage and the use of the POWER formula.
Visual Organization: Exercises in Conditional Formatting, sorting by cell color, and sorting numbers/text.
Automation: The Macros sheet and mentions of "Basics of Macros" in Sheet1 indicate that the workbook also covers basic automation of these reporting tasks
