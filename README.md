📖 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze retail performance across the United States. It breaks down sales data by region, product category, and time period to identify profitability drivers and operational bottlenecks.

🌟 Key Features
Multi-Dimensional Analysis: Sales tracking across 4 regions (East, West, Central, South) and multiple product sub-categories (Bookcases, Chairs, Technology, etc.).

Data Engineering: Includes dedicated sheets for Data Cleaning (TRIM, PROPER, LEN) and Logical Functions.

Advanced Lookups: Implementation of VLOOKUP vs. HLOOKUP for dynamic report generation.

Automation: A dedicated module for Excel Macros to streamline repetitive reporting tasks.

Financial Health: Calculation of KPIs such as Profit Margin, Discount Impact, and Shipping Lag.

Core Insights Summarized
Based on the data analysis within these files:

Regional Performance: The East region shows significant volume, but regional pivots suggest high variability in "Tables" and "Bookcases" profitability.

Category Trends: Technology remains the highest-margin category, while Furniture often sees profit dips due to aggressive discounting (visible in the Discount vs Profit columns).

Operational Efficiency: Standard Class is the dominant shipping mode; however, the Ship Date analysis reveals opportunities to optimize lead times for the South region.

Data Manipulation & Logic
Excel Formulas: Extensive use of logical and text functions including:

Data Cleaning: TRIM, PROPER, UPPER, LOWER, LEN, VALUE, LEFT, RIGHT, MID.

Search & Find: SEARCH and FIND functions for string manipulation.

Logical Functions: IF, AND, OR statements.

Lookup Formulas: Implementation of VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP to connect data across different tables.

 Automation
Excel Macros (VBA): There is a dedicated section for "Basics of Macros," implying that automated scripts were used to consolidate reports or perform repetitive tasks.

. Business Intelligence & Reporting
Pivot Tables: A dedicated section ("Pivot Table A-Z") shows that pivot tables were the main tool for aggregating sales by region, category, and month.

Conditional Formatting: Used for visual data analysis to highlight trends, outliers, or specific KPIs.

Conditional Aggregation: Use of functions like SUMIF, COUNTIF, and AVERAGEIF.

Data Consolidation: Techniques to merge data from multiple sheets (like Jan, March, and Sales Data) into a single report.

 Data Engineering
Text to Columns: Used for splitting data values.

Find & Replace: For batch cleaning of data.

Go To Special: A technique used for advanced data selection and cleaning (e.g., selecting all blanks).
